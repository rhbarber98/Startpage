## Setting it up On Firefox

- Go to "about:preferences#home" (Options in top right menu > home), set "Homepage and new windows" to
Custom URLs and enter "file:///path/to/the/index.html"

- Set "New tabs" to "Blank Page" then go to the installation folder of Firefox,
"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox" is default on Windows, open "defaults" then "pref" and put the "autoconfig.js" (from "Firefox_cfg") there. Go back to the installation folder and paste "autoconfig.cfg" (from "Firefox_cfg") in, open it and edit the "newTabURL" to the file path of the index.html
